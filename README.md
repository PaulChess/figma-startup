## Why we need to learn design as a fontend enginner?
1. As a frontend enginner, mastering the process of making design drafts allows us to `think better of the designing ideas about css`.
2. We can `know more professional knowledge` in design such as some font families so that we can better `collaborate with our designers`.
3. `Improve our aesthetic ability`. We need this everywhere in our life.
4. Figma、Sketch or some other design tools are both relative with low code tools in cetain aspects, their experience is very great so that we can gain some experience from them to `make the experience of our lowcode platform better`.
