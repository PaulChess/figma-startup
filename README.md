Some figma learning exercise. @paulchess

## Why we need to learn design as a fontend enginner?
1. As a frontend enginner, mastering `the process of making design drafts` allows us to `think better of the designing ideas about css`.
2. We can `know more professional knowledge` such as some font families in design so that we can better `collaborate with our designers`.
3. `Improve our aesthetic ability`. We need this everywhere in our life.
4. Figma、Sketch or some other design tools are both relative with low code tools in cetain aspects, their experience is very great so that we can gain some experience from them to `make the experience of our lowcode platform better`.
